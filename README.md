# Welcome

**Self-Taught Systems Builder**  
"Knowledge is earned by building. Mastery is measured in results."

## Approach
- **Build Over Theory**: Code exists to work, not to be discussed.
- **Self-Driven Growth**: Progress is internal. Each project pushes the boundary of what I can create.
- **Essentials First**: Fundamentals drive excellence. Each line adds clarity, purpose, and resilience.

## Focus
- Projects as proof of practical skill and growth
- Code crafted for durability and purpose
- Documentation thatâ€™s lean, direct, and useful

> "Mastery belongs to those who create."
