**Just a Hobbyist Programmer – Coding for Fun in My Spare Time**

## About Me
I’m a hobbyist developer who enjoys coding once in a while. I primarily focus on Java and like to tinker with projects in my free time. This profile is just a collection of things I’ve put together while exploring programming as a hobby.

## Approach
- **Learning by Doing**: Each project reflects something I’ve picked up along the way.
- **Simple and Practical**: I focus on straightforward, practical applications.
- **Always Exploring**: I enjoy experimenting with new tools and techniques whenever I have some spare time.

## Skills Showcased
- **Java & OOP**: Applying core concepts in small projects.
- **Database Basics**: Simple integrations with MySQL/PostgreSQL.
- **Error Handling**: Trying to build more reliable programs, bit by bit.

Thanks for stopping by!
