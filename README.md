### Self-Taught Developer | Builder in Progress

---

> **“Learning without building is wasted effort.”**

Tutorials are a starting point, not an endgame. If you're serious, work on a project. Everything else is just distraction.

---

### **Core Principles**

- **Build Relentlessly**: Code is meant to be executed, not theorized.
- **Direct Progress**: Every feature, every line, every improvement—measured and deliberate.
- **Focus on Fundamentals**: Learning through action, not through endless explanations.

---

### **Contents**

- Projects in active development.
- Purpose-driven code, structured for growth.
- Documentation for clarity and precision—no filler, just facts.

---

> **"Results over rhetoric."**

---

For those who understand: keep building.
